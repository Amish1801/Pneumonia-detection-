# Google colab link for Pneumonia-detection
Developed a machine learning model using Python and TensorFlow to accurately detect pneumonia (Bacterial or Viral) from medical chest X-ray images. Gathered X-rays from DY Patil hospitals and utilized them to train the machine learning model, ensuring its validity and effectiveness in real-world applications.
